        \item{Researching efficient video inference systems through spatiotemporal knowledge.
        With cost-based optimization, our system trains proxy ML models to minimize the execution of expensive oracle ML models through input compressions and fine-tuning of the oracle models.}
        \item{Designed and developed Spatialyze: a video data analysis system, focusing on geo-spatial-related queries and optimizations. Through our programming paradigm, Spatialyze executes less expensive ML operations by integrating geospatial metadata, achieving more than 2x speed.}

        \item {
          Contributed to \textbf{Vega-Lite} (\href{https://www.github.com/vega/vega-lite}{\textit{github.com/vega/vega-lite}}), a \underline{web-based} high-level grammar of interactive graphic for generating easy-to-understand visualization.
          Designed and implemented grammar for creating error bar/error band,
          enabling users to create error bar/band chart without the need to manually compose different types of marks.
          As a result, the specification for creating an error bar chart is \underline{shortened by half}.
        }
        \item {
          Contributed to \textbf{Arquero} (\href{https://www.github.com/chanwutk/arquero-sql}{\textit{github.com/chanwutk/arquero-sql}}), a query processing library in JS.
          Designed and implemented Arquero-SQL as an alternative execution engine to Arquero's own engine in JS.
          Arquero-SQL executes Arquero queries on an SQL server to achieve better performance and scalability.
