          \textbf{Primary project:} Design and create a visualixer for deep-learning models and their performance using D3/TypeScript.
          The visualizer is a part of the optimizer tool (Octomizer) that optimizes deep-learning models compiled by TVM and measures their performances.
        }
        \item {
          \textbf{Secondary project:} Create visualization for comparing performance across different deep-learning models from different compiler engines.
          The visualization is a part of a dashboard for comparing multiple deep-learning models' performance.
          The visualization is created using Vega.

        \item {
          Contributing to the development of \textbf{Vega-Lite}, a high-level grammar of interactive graphic for generating easy-to-understand visualization.
        }
        \item {
          Design and implement grammar for creating error bar/error band;
          users can use the grammar to create error bar/band chart without having to do redundant work of combining multiple parts of error bar/band.
          As a result, the specification for creating error bar chart is \underline{shortened by half}.

          Contributing to the development of \textbf{Arquero}, a query processing library in JavaScript.
        }
        \item {
          The project Arquero-SQL adds SQL back-end support for Arquero queries to achieve better performance and scalability. Arquero-SQL generate a SQL query from an Arquero query.
          Then, it sends the SQL query to an SQL back-end to be executed and retrieves the execution result.

        \item {
          The system is developed with python and spark. My contribution includes two main works.
          First, design AWS lambda to auto-shutdown idle EMR clusters and notebooks to prevent unnecessary cost when the service is still running but not doing any work.
          Second, design a spark job to keep the schema of the service's database up-to-date and to clean up unused files from failed data ingestion to prevent dirty data from being analyzed.
