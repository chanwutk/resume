I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley researching efficient video analytics systems that leverage {\bf spatiotemporal properties to accelerate video inference}.
I designed and developed Spatialyze, a geospatial video analytics system published at VLDB 2024, where I explored optimization techniques that balance accuracy and performance in computer vision tasks.
Through its development, I gained a deep understanding of how spatial and temporal knowledge can minimize expensive ML operations, the trade-offs between model precision and computational cost, and the challenges in large-scale video inferences.
I have interned at OctoML, developing ML model visualizers, and at DocuSign, optimizing cloud infrastructure.
With expertise in ML inferencing and training infrastructure, I am seeking an {\bf internship in ML systems optimization}, focusing on large-scale video inference acceleration and infrastructure.
